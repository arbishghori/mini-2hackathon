          <p>There are 8,000 different kinds of sports which give you a lot of options to choose from when starting these types of blogs. You can either narrow-in on one type of sport or cover several (just not all 8,000). In the case of Kollege Sports, the writer focuses primarily on college football and basketball.


            Once you've decided your sports category, pick a team or athlete for your first post. You can also write about the history of the physical activity or game and why you believe it's risen to popularity. If you are more of a talker and less of a writer, consider starting a podcast and integrating it into your sports coverage. 
            
            
            To grow your readers or listeners, make sure your content is valuable and engaging by offering your original perspective on topics. Also, try to link to other reputable sports websites to build trust with your readers. Showing you've done your research will make you more credible and hopefully bring people back to your blog.   </p>

          <p>Interior design blogs

            Did interior designers coin the phrase "Home sweet home"? We wouldn't be surprised. Talented home decor bloggers give guidance on beautifying houses or businesses with furniture, accessories, color schemes and wall art. When they are not decorating a physical space, designers such as Lux Living Weekly also teach online design workshops. Offering interior design services and selling decor products are common in this community. 
            
            
            Consider making yourself an expert rather than a jack-of-all-trades. Many interior design bloggers found success by specializing in designing specific areas such as nurseries, bachelor pads or studios. Can you think of a niche you'd want to be known for? This is something you can work towards with time. You can always start with the experience you already have. If you've designed a space that you can showcase post before-and-after photos and explain the style and color choices you made.

          <p> Before planning a trip, we tend to do a lot of research on both Google and social media. Therefore, the demand for reading other people's travel reviews is high. If you’re a globetrotter and a freelancer, consider this type of outlet. You can start with an insider’s guide on places to explore near you, offering reasons to visit your very own hometown, region or country.


            We recommend honing in on a travel niche, whether it’s a type of hotel (luxury hotels, hostels, etc.), a kind of trip (backpacking, camping, etc.) or a geographical area. For instance, the blogger behind Tales Of Israel shares inspiring guides focusing only on the Holy Land. This makes her an expert and a trustworthy source to readers.
            
            
            Dave Grohl said, "No one is you, and that is your power." It’s true that almost all corners of the world have been written about, but they have not been written about by you. People will experience your destinations through your eyes. Help them get to know you and the reasons you like traveling with an intriguing About Me page.
            
            
            On top of the recognition, some successful bloggers get free hotel stays or even sponsored travel experiences and can also generate income through ads on their site.

             <p>   Food blogs

              Food blogs come in several flavors. On the one hand, there’s the food critics, who go from one restaurant table to the next, tasting different dishes and narrating their experiences. On the other hand, there’s the cooking and baking enthusiasts. They document their recipes—from the ingredients they use to the steps they follow—and share them with their communities through articles, photos and videos.
              
              
              These types of blogs come with much competition. Therefore, many foodies have chosen a specific blog niche to stand out—such as Wild Plant Food, which specializes in 100% vegan recipes. Know that the work also comes with great perks. Critics often get to dine for free at restaurants. If you’re more on the cooking side, you may meet opportunities to publish cookbooks and collaborate with food networks. Despite the competition food blogging is a great way to build a food loving online community of like minded people.

             <p> Lifestyle blogs

              Lifestyle blogs are the new magazines. As we once flipped through pages, nowadays, we scroll for inspiration. Lifestyle bloggers create multimedia centered content around their daily lives. Therefore, these types of blogs often integrate vlogs (video blogs) to engage their audience and to show their expertise. These bloggers later tend to partner with brands as micro-influencers.
              
              
              For example, Laura Baross focuses on sustainable living and design. Her interests and opinions vary from topics such as second-hand fashion to compostable toothbrushes. Maybe you don’t identify as an environmentalist, but you surely have something that makes your own lifestyle inspiring

             <p>Health and fitness blogs 

              The most common New Year's resolution is to exercise more and lose weight. Yet, less than 5% of adults participate in 30 minutes of physical activity each day. What about giving your readers an extra push of motivation? Blogging is a great way to share your insight on at-home workouts and eating best practices while going direct to your consumer.
              
              
              Start by making a list of your own routines and habits, and turn them into guides filled with exact steps. For obvious reasons, people expect to find videos on these types of blogs, so buying a decent camera and using Wix Video is something to consider when you begin.
              
              
              Writing a sports and wellness blog can be the beginning of a very fruitful journey. You can follow the steps of certified personal trainers and dietitians such as Nora Minno and use a scheduling software to increase clientele. Other bloggers also sell workout guides, diet recipe ebooks, supplements and workout apparel.

Each character hails from a different background and yet they all achieve their dreams despite all odds to join the army and serve the nation. Even though they are different from one another, one thing each woman has in common in the trailer is that “she doesn’t need a hero, she was raised to be one.”

      <h2>Blog Post 9</h2>
     <p>  Umera Ahmed (born in 10,December 1974 in Sialkot) is an Urdu novelist and screenplay writer who is mostly popular for writing Peer-e-Kamil…
      In this book there is a story of a girl who was from Qadyani firqa and she got the noor-e-hidayat and turned to Muslim but her family didn’t allow her to do this but she did as she was engaged with one of her cousin who was also qadyani so it wasn’t possible her to get marry with him so she takes help of his neighbor named Salar who has +150 I.Q.Level he was very different guy but the both Imama (the girl who turned Muslim from qadyani) and Salar don’t like each other.Salar was the guy who was in the depth of sins but after some time he got changing in herself and he realized lots of things about Islam, about life about the reality.
      Coming to point after salutation, the facts shown in the book were heart & soul shaking. Many among us don’t think about this and coming life but only consider it as to have the luxuries and to relax after working hard for gathering these luxuries. The only right path starts from ALLAH (subhana wat aala) and ends at his beloved last Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (salalaho alaihe wasalam). Not as many words in mind to give the compliments.
      Life is to live according to what deem you right, not what the system deem it right. God has given us the ability to differentiate between right and wrong. And when we are given the option, we have to choose wisely, we won’t be given chances too many times.
