                <p>  There are 8,000 different kinds of sports which give you a lot of options to choose from when starting these types of blogs. You can either narrow-in on one type of sport or cover several (just not all 8,000). In the case of Kollege Sports, the writer focuses primarily on college football and basketball.


                    Once you've decided your sports category, pick a team or athlete for your first post. You can also write about the history of the physical activity or game and why you believe it's risen to popularity. If you are more of a talker and less of a writer, consider starting a podcast and integrating it into your sports coverage. 
                    
                    
                    To grow your readers or listeners, make sure your content is valuable and engaging by offering your original perspective on topics. Also, try to link to other reputable sports websites to build trust with your readers. Showing you've done your research will make you more credible and hopefully bring people back to your blog.   </p>

                <p>   Interior design blogs

                    Did interior designers coin the phrase "Home sweet home"? We wouldn't be surprised. Talented home decor bloggers give guidance on beautifying houses or businesses with furniture, accessories, color schemes and wall art. When they are not decorating a physical space, designers such as Lux Living Weekly also teach online design workshops. Offering interior design services and selling decor products are common in this community. 
                    
                    
                    Consider making yourself an expert rather than a jack-of-all-trades. Many interior design bloggers found success by specializing in designing specific areas such as nurseries, bachelor pads or studios. Can you think of a niche you'd want to be known for? This is something you can work towards with time. You can always start with the experience you already have. If you've designed a space that you can showcase post before-and-after photos and explain the style and color choices you made.
